# TODOs

## Unity
- (warning!) directionTable and assigning direction are wrong: turning left and right is not balanced across each layout. Check PrepareCondition and Line 576-606
- calibratedDistance --> UnityDistance
- file names set up
- trialID and participantID are reversed
- Y axis data can be removed
- LayoutBlockNum can be removed
- move TargetName to the other factor variables

## analysis work
- check if three decoys mess up people's performance badly three decoys vs. two decoys
- When removing outlier, do it buy each participant, each condition.

```{r}
# y
# conditions and layouts (5,6,7) have some mistakes. Need to check that
dta_y <- read.table("1003/filesP1003_erf.csv", sep=",", h=T)
dta_q_y <- read.table("1003/filesP1003_questionnaire.csv", sep = ",", h=T)
dta_c_y <- read.table("1003/filesP1003Calibration_erf.csv", sep = ",", h=T)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
